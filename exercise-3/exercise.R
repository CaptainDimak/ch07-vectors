# Exercise 3: Vector and function practice

# Create a vector `marbles` with 6 different colors in it (representing marbles)

## Use the `sample` function to select a single random marble
## You may want to read documentation for 'sample'


# Write a function MarbleGame that does the following:
# - Takes in a `guess` of a marble color
# - Randomly samples a marble
# - Returns whether or not the person guessed accurately (preferrably a full phrase)


# Play the marble game!


## -------------------- challenge1 --------------------
## Play the marble game until you win, keeping track of how many tries you take

## -------------------- challenge 2 --------------------
## play the game 1000X, each time until you win,
## and track the average number of tries

## Is it what you expected based on the probability?
